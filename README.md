This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_50/) manually implements the L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization and ElasticNet Regularization algorithms with fixed values applied for the learning rate and iteration count parameters to impose constraints on the weight updates of an artificial neural network classification model. The weight, cost function and classification accuracy optimization profiles of the different activation settings were evaluated and compared.
